This application allows you to take notes easily with PyQt5. Otherwise, I used JSON Database to keep note datas in database.json file and I used Qt Designer to design the program.

## Features

-   **Edit a note**: Edit a note in notes widget by double clicking
-   **Move notes**: Move notes between each other
-   **Delete a note**: Delete a note by right clicking

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mali03/basic-note-app

4.  Run the "main.py" with python
